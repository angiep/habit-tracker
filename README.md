I'm building out this habit tracker app as practice for upcoming interviews.

## Current Features
- [x] Display a January 2023 calendar
- [x] Display a list of predefined habits on each calendar day
- [x] Allow the user to check off if they have completed the habit for the day
- [x] Allow the user to uncheck if they have completed the habit for the day 
- [x] Store the user's completion data in local storage

## In the Future
- [ ] Correctly adjust for beginning and end of month on the calendar (January 2023 happens to start on a Sunday...)
- [ ] Display each month on it's given URL, e.g. `/2023/01` and allow the user to click through each month
- [ ] Allow user to edit the list of habits (they are hardcoded right now)
- [ ] Improve design / make responsive for mobile
